HtmlUnit and dynamic styles
===========================

After upgrading HtmlUnit from 2.15 to 2.17, some elements are being not "displayed", even major browsers display it. This elements are labels with a 'dynamic' style, based on size.

This repo contains a JUnit test which works using 2.15, but on changing to newer version, it fails.
